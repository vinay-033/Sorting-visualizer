# Sorting-visualizer
A Sorting Visualizer is an interactive application designed to help users understand and visualize the process of sorting algorithms. Sorting algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science and are used to arrange elements in a particular order, typically numerical or lexicographical. The visual representation of these algorithms can significantly enhance comprehension, making abstract concepts more tangible and easier to grasp. Here's a detailed description of what a Sorting Visualizer entails: Key Features Interactive Interface:

The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can select different sorting algorithms and watch their execution in real-time. Users can control the speed of the visualization, pause, resume, and reset the sorting process. Algorithm Selection:

Commonly visualized algorithms include Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. Each algorithm is presented with an option for the user to select and visualize. Array Configuration: Users can generate arrays of different sizes and with varying elements, such as random values, sorted values, or reverse-sorted values. The visualizer typically represents array elements as bars of varying heights, with the height corresponding to the value of the element. Step-by-Step Visualization:

The visualizer shows each step of the sorting process, illustrating how elements are compared, swapped, or moved. Color-coding is often used to highlight active elements being compared or swapped. Educational Content: The application might include descriptions and explanations of each algorithm, detailing their time complexity, space complexity, and use cases. Some visualizers provide pseudocode or actual code snippets alongside the visualization. Performance Metrics:

Users can see real-time metrics such as the number of comparisons, swaps, and elapsed time, helping them understand the efficiency of each algorithm.
